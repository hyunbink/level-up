        "Neos and Sulawesi are two radically different shrimps with wildly different sets of tank parameters. Keeping them together is typically a death sentence for on or both of the shrimps, but today I'm going to show you how I make it work.",
        "The path to true beauty is one of sacrifice and bloodshed. To get the patterns and colors that you want, you will have to cull your shrimp. This video will show you how to do it as humanely as possible and eventually get your desired shrimps.",
        "Although a well established tank should be self-sufficient, it's always helpful to supplement your shrimps' diets with various types of nutrient-rich foods. Today's video walks you through some of my favorites, as well as community recommended foods that are proven to produce healthier and more colorful shrimp.",
        "Unfortunately, many fish stores and plant suppliers have tanks that, at some point or another, become hosts to a variety of parasites and unwanted guests. Those pests will hitch a ride on the plants and animals that eventually get into your tank. It's important to quarantine everything you purchase before setting them into your own aquariums"

        "In addition to being illegal in many states, hedgehogs can be a bit more than people can handle as a first pet. It's important to realize what you're getting into beforehand, and to give your potential new friend the best home it can have.",
        "Don't call the feds on me. I promise you everything I say in this video is legal. At most, they are a light shade of morally grey."
